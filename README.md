This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS with percentage values. The problem arises when the calculation depends on the parent element's size, but the parent's size hasn't been computed yet. This often results in unexpected layout or sizing behavior.  The `bug.css` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version.
