To resolve this, ensure that the parent element has explicitly defined dimensions (height and/or width) or use a different approach that doesn't rely on the parent element's size being calculated before the child element's `calc()` calculation.  Sometimes, restructuring the HTML or adjusting the CSS order can resolve this issue.

Example:
Instead of:
```css
#parent {
  width: 50%;
}

#child {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```
Consider:
```css
#parent {
  width: 50%;
  height: 200px; /* Add explicit height */
}

#child {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```
Or, if possible, avoid percentage calculations that depend on the parent's size entirely.
